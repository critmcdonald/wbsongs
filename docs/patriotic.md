## America (My Country ‘Tis of Thee)
My country! ‘Tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing;<br>
Land where my fathers died, Land of the pilgrims’ pride,<br>
From every mountainside Let freedom ring.<br>

My native country, thee, Land of the noble free, Thy name I love;<br>
I love thy rocks and rills, Thy woods and templed hills;<br>
My heart with rapture thrills Like that above.<br>

Our father’s God to thee, Author of liberty, To thee we sing;<br>
Long may our land be bright, With freedom’s holy light;<br>
Protect us by thy might, Great God, our King.

## America (round)

America, America<br>
How can I tell you how I  feel.<br>
You have given me many treasures,<br>
I love you so.<br>

America, America<br>
Land of hope and Liberty<br>
Freedom rings from every mountain<br>
From sea to sea

## America The Beautiful

Oh beautiful for spacious skies,<br>
For amber waves of grain,<br>
For purple mountains majesty<br>
Above the fruited plain.<br>
America! America!<br>
God shed his grace on thee<br>
And crown thy good with brotherhood<br>
From sea to shining sea!

<a name="battlehymn"></a>
## Battle Hymn of the Republic

Mine eyes have seen the glory<br>
Of the coming of the Lord.<br>
He is trampling out the vintage<br>
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;<br>
He has loosed the fateful lightening<br>
Of his terrible swift sword;<br>
His truth is marching on.<br>

#### Chorus:

Glory, glory hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory hallelujah!<br>
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires<br>
Of a hundred circling camps,<br>
They have builded Him an altar<br>
In the evening dews and damps.<br>
I have read His righteous sentence<br>
By the dim and flaring lamps.<br>
His day is marching on.<br>

(chorus)

<a name="columbia"></a>
## Columbia, the Gem Of The Ocean

O Columbia, the gem of the ocean,<br>
The home of the brave and the free,<br>
The shrine of each patriot’s devotion,<br>
The world offers homage to thee.<br>

Thy mandates make heroes assemble,<br>
When Liberty’s form stands in view;<br>
Thy banners make tyranny tremble,<br>
When borne by the red, white, and blue!<br>

When borne by the red, white, and blue!<br>
When borne by the red, white, and blue!<br>
Thy banners make tyranny tremble,<br>
When borne by the red, white, and blue!<br>

<a name="godbless"></a>
## God Bless America

God bless America, land that I love.<br>
Stand beside her, and guide her,<br>
Through the night with a light from above.<br>
From the mountains, to the prairies,<br>
To the oceans, white with foam-<br>
God bless America! My home, sweet home.<br>
God bless America! My home, sweet home<br>

<a name="spangled"></a>
## Star-Spangled Banner

O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,<br>
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,<br>
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?<br>
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br>
Gave proof thro’ the night that our flag was still there!<br>
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br>

<a name="texas"></a>
## Texas Our Texas

Texas, our Texas!  All hail the mighty state!<br>
Texas, our Texas! So wonderful, so great!<br>
Boldest and grandest, withstanding ev’ry test<br>
O Empire wide and glorious, you stand supremely blest.<br>

#### Chorus

God bless you Texas, and keep you brave and strong,<br>
That you may grow in power and worth, throughout the ages long!<br>
God bless you Texas, and keep you brave and strong,<br>
That you may grow in power and worth, throughout the ages long!<br>

<a name="txpledge"></a>
## Texas Pledge
Honor the Texas flag; I pledge allegiance to thee,<br>
Texas, one state under God, one and indivisible.	

<a name="land"></a>
## This Land Is Your Land

#### Chorus

This land is your land, This land is my land,<br>
From California, To the New York Island<br>
From the Redwood Forest, To the Gulf Stream waters,<br>
This land was made for you and me.

As I went walking that ribbon of highway,<br>
I saw above me that endless skyway,<br>
I saw below me that Golden Valley<br>
This land was made for you and me.<br>

(Chorus)

I’ve roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps<br>
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts<br>
And all around me, a voice was sounding,<br>
This land is made for you and me. <br>

(Chorus)

When the sun came shining, and I was strolling<br>
And the wheat was waving and the dust clouds rolling,<br>
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting,<br>
This land was made for you and me. <br>

(Chorus)

<a name="doodle"></a>
## Yankee Doodle

Yankee Doodle went to town, a-riding on a pony;<br>
Stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni. <br>

#### Chorus

Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy,<br>
Mind the music and the step and with the girls be handy.<br>

Father and I went down to camp along with Captain Gooding<br>
And there we saw the men and boys, as thick as hasty pudding.

(chorus)

There was Colonel Washington, upon a strapping stallion,<br>
A-giving orders to his men, I guess there was a million. (chorus)

And there I saw a cannon barrel as big as mother's basin,<br>
And every time they touched it off they scampered like the nation. 

(chorus)

<a name="grand"></a>
## You’re A Grand Old Flag

You’re a grand old flag.<br>
You’re a high a high flying flag<br>
And forever in peace may you wave<br>
You’re the emblem of the land I love<br>
The home of the free and the brave.

Every heart beats true,<br>
For the Red, White, and Blue,<br>
Where there’s never a boast or brag.<br>
But, should old acquaintance be forgot,<br>
Keep your eye on the Grand Old Flag.
