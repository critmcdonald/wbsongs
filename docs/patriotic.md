# Patriotic Songs


## America (My Country ‘Tis of Thee)
My country! ‘Tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing;<br>
Land where my fathers died, Land of the pilgrims’ pride,<br>
From every mountainside Let freedom ring.<br>

My native country, thee, Land of the noble free, Thy name I love;<br>
I love thy rocks and rills, Thy woods and templed hills;<br>
My heart with rapture thrills Like that above.<br>

Our father’s God to thee, Author of liberty, To thee we sing;<br>
Long may our land be bright, With freedom’s holy light;<br>
Protect us by thy might, Great God, our King.

## America (round)

America, America<br>
How can I tell you how I  feel.<br>
You have given me many treasures,<br>
I love you so.<br>

America, America<br>
Land of hope and Liberty<br>
Freedom rings from every mountain<br>
From sea to sea


## America The Beautiful

Oh beautiful for spacious skies,<br>
For amber waves of grain,<br>
For purple mountains majesty<br>
Above the fruited plain.<br>
America! America!<br>
God shed his grace on thee<br>
And crown thy good with brotherhood<br>
From sea to shining sea!
