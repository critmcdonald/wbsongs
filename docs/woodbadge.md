# Wood Badge Songs

## Back to Gilwell

This song is traditionally sung at Wood Badge courses and events.  Assemblies, campfires and any troop gathering time are great times for this song. Beavers set the pace!

I used to be a Beaver,<br>
And a good old Beaver too,<br>
But now I've finished Beavering,<br>
I don't know what to do,<br>
I'm growing old and feeble,<br>
And I can Beaver no more,<br>
So I'm going to work my ticket if I can.<br>

#### Chorus:

Back to Gilwell, happy land,<br>
I'm going to work my ticket if I can<br>

## It’s in Every One of Us – ‘Wood Badge Spirit’ Lyrics

(by David Pomeranz with additional ‘Wood Badge Spirit’ words by Randall K. Cline)

It's in every one of us to be wise.<br>
Find your heart, open up both your eyes. <br>
We can all know everything,<br>
Without ever knowing why.<br>
It's in every one of us, by and by.<br>

It's in every one of us, a kindred spirit <br>
Awakening me from within. <br>
I'm not all that I can be, but I have a vision <br>
That calls me; let's begin.<br>

I've been realizing that my life is passing. <br>
It's time to get into the show. <br>
Lead to make a difference, serve because I care, <br>
And then love, 'cause I know, that is all one need know.<br>

It's in every one of us to be wise. <br>
Find your heart, open up both your eyes. <br>
We can all know everything,<br>
Without ever knowing why. <br>
It's in every one of us, by and by.<br>
It's in every one of us, by and by.<br>

## Twelve Days of Wood Badge

On my first day at Wood Badge,<br>
Troop 1 gave to me…<br>
A patrol site with poison ivy<br>
2 more tickets<br>
3 bouncy Beavers<br>
4 bodacious Bobwhites<br>
5 Gilwell pennants<br>
6 soaring Eagles<br>
7 flashy Foxes<br>
8 Owls a-hooting<br>
9 Bears a-growling<br>
10 Buffaloes a roaming<br>
11 Antelopes a loping<br>
12 Staffers staffing<br>

## Wood Badge Den Song

(Tune: If You’re Happy and You Know It)

If you’re a Beaver and you know it, slap your tail!<br>
If you’re a Beaver and you know it, slap your tail!<br>
If you’re a Beaver and you know it<br>
Then you really ought to show it.<br>
If you’re a Beaver and you know it, slap your tail!<br>

* **Beaver** - Slap your tail
* **Bobwhite** - Bob your head
* **Eagle** - Flap your wings
* **Fox** - Scamper around
* **Owl** - Shout “Who Who”
* **Bear** - Scratch your back
* **Buffalo** - Stomp your feet
* **Antelope** - Jump up high

## Wood Badge Farewell Song

(Tune: Auld Lang Syne)

The time has come for all of us to bid our fond farewell.<br>
We leave behind, love for mankind within the field Gilwell.<br>
God bless us each and everyone.<br>
May Scouting never cease.<br>
May Wood Badge stay within our hearts, and give us lasting peace.<br>

Where e’re we go the world will know our fellowship is good.<br>
We’ll reach our goal and bells will toll about Scout brotherhood.<br>
The soul of Baden-Powell lives on and we shall never fail.<br>
Our course is set.  We’ll ne’er forget ...  We walked the Wood Badge trail.

Please guide the Wood Badge staff dear Lord, in reverence to thee.<br>
And bless them God, they worked so hard and taught a Scout like me.<br>
O’Great Scoutmaster of all Scouts, on you we can rely.<br>
That someday you will call us to your Gilwell Field on high.<br>
