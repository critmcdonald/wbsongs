## Cub Scout Advancement Song

(Tune: Farmer in the Dell)

Cub Scouting we will go,<br>
Cub Scouting we will go,<br>
Hi, ho, the daireo,<br>
Cub Scouting we will go.<br>

(follow the same pattern)<br>
The Bobcat makes a Wolf…

The Wolf Cub makes a Bear…

Then next is We-be-los…

The Webelos makes a Scout…

A-Scouting we will go…
