## Cub Scout Pack
(Tune: "You’re a Grand Old Flag")

We’re a Cub Scout pack, <br>
We’re a high-flying pack;<br>
Down the trail of Akela we go,<br>

From Wolf to Bear<br>
To We-be-los,<br>
As into good Cub Scouts we grow.<br>

Every Cub is true to the gold and the blue,<br>
And he never forgets the fact<br>

That all the fun a boy could want<br>
He can find in a Cub Scout pack.

## On My Honor
(Traditional Version)

A great Wood Badge song for closing campfires and other ceremonies. Usually sung through twice.

On my honor, I'll do my best.<br>
To do my duty to God.<br>
On my honor, I'll do my best.<br>
To serve my country as I may.<br>
On my honor, I'll do my best.<br>
To do a good turn each day.<br>
To keep my body strengthened,<br>
And to keep my mind awakened.<br>
To follow paths of right-eous-ness,<br>
On my honor, I'll do my best
