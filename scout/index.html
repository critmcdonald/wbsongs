<h2 id="cub-scout-pack">Cub Scout Pack</h2>
<p>(Tune: "You’re a Grand Old Flag")</p>
<p>We’re a Cub Scout pack, <br>
We’re a high-flying pack;<br>
Down the trail of Akela we go,<br></p>
<p>From Wolf to Bear<br>
To We-be-los,<br>
As into good Cub Scouts we grow.<br></p>
<p>Every Cub is true to the gold and the blue,<br>
And he never forgets the fact<br></p>
<p>That all the fun a boy could want<br>
He can find in a Cub Scout pack.</p>
<h2 id="on-my-honor">On My Honor</h2>
<p>(Traditional Version)</p>
<p>A great Wood Badge song for closing campfires and other ceremonies. Usually sung through twice.</p>
<p>On my honor, I'll do my best.<br>
To do my duty to God.<br>
On my honor, I'll do my best.<br>
To serve my country as I may.<br>
On my honor, I'll do my best.<br>
To do a good turn each day.<br>
To keep my body strengthened,<br>
And to keep my mind awakened.<br>
To follow paths of right-eous-ness,<br>
On my honor, I'll do my best</p>
<h2 id="philmont-hymn">Philmont Hymn</h2>
<p>Silver on the sage,<br>
Starlit skies above,<br>
Aspen covered hills,<br>
Country that I love.<br>
Philmont here's to thee,<br>
Scouting Paradise,<br>
Out in God's country, tonight<br></p>
<p>Wind in whispering pines,<br>
Eagles soaring high,<br>
Purple mountains rise,<br>
Against an azure sky.<br>
Philmont here's to thee,<br>
Scouting Paradise,<br>
Out in God's country tonight</p>
<h2 id="scout-leader-spirit">Scout Leader Spirit</h2>
<p>(Tune: Scouting Spirit)</p>
<p>I’ve got the Boy Scout tents in my living room,<br>
My living room, my living room.<br>
I’ve got the Boy Scout tents in my living room,<br>
My living room to stay.</p>
<p>I’ve got the Cub Scout flags in the back of my car,<br>
Back of my car, back of my car.<br>
I’ve got the Cub Scout flags in the back of my car,<br>
Back of my car to stay.</p>
<p>I’ve got the Scouting stuff all over the house,<br>
All over the house, all over the house.<br>
I’ve got the Scouting stuff all over the house,<br>
All over the house to stay.</p>
<p>I’ve got the Scouting spirit surrounding me,<br>
Surrounding me, surrounding me.<br>
I’ve got the Scouting spirit surrounding me,<br>
Surrounding me to stay.</p>
<h2 id="scout-vespers">Scout Vespers</h2>
<p>(Tune: Tannenbaum)</p>
<p>Softly falls the light of day,<br>
As our campfire fades away,<br>
Silently each scout should ask,<br>
Have I done my daily task.<br>
Have I kept my honor bright?<br>
Can I guiltless sleep tonight?<br>
Have I done and have I dared<br>
Everything to be prepared?</p>
<h2 id="cub-scout-vespers">Cub Scout Vespers</h2>
<p>Softly falls the light of day<br>
As our campfire fades away,<br>
Silently each Cub should ask<br>
Have I done my daily task?<br>
For my country done my best<br>
Prayed to God before I rest.<br>
Helped a friend along the way?<br>
Have I done my best today?</p>
<h2 id="taps">Taps</h2>
<p>Day is done, gone the sun,<br>
From the lake, from the hills, from the sky;<br>
All is well, safely rest, God is nigh. <br></p>
<p>Fading light, dims the sight,<br>
And a star gems the sky, gleaming bright.<br>
From afar, drawing nigh, falls the night. </p>
<p>Thanks and praise, for our days,<br>
'Neath the sun, 'neath the stars, neath the sky;<br>
As we go, this we know, God is nigh. </p>
<p>Sun has set, shadows come,<br>
Time has fled, Scouts must go to their beds<br>
Always true to the promise that they made. </p>
<p>While the light fades from sight,<br>
And the stars gleaming rays softly send,<br>
To thy hands we our souls, Lord, commend.</p>
<h2 id="trail-the-eagle">Trail the Eagle</h2>
<p>(Tune: "On Wisconsin")</p>
<p>Trail the Eagle,<br>
Trail the Eagle, <br>
Climbing all the time. <br>
First the Star and then the Life,<br>
Will on your bosom shine.<br>
KEEP CLIMBING!<br>
Blaze the trail and we will follow,<br>
Hark the Eagles' call;<br>
On, brothers, on until we're Eagles all.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-tell-a-scout-from-texas">You Can Tell a Scout From Texas</h2>
<p>(Tune: The Yellow Rose of Texas)</p>
<p>You can tell a Scout from Texas,<br>
You can tell him by his talk,<br>
You can tell a Scout from Texas,<br>
You can tell him by his walk,<br>
You can tell a Scout from Texas,<br>
By his appetite and such,<br>
You can tell a Scout from Texas,<br>
But you sure can’t tell him much! </p>
<h2 id="webelos-graduation-song">Webelos Graduation Song</h2>
<p>(Tune: "Red River Valley")</p>
<p>From Cub Scouting we soon will be leaving;<br>
Do not hasten to bid us adieu<br><br>
But remember us Webelos Cub Scouts,
And the boys who have played long with you.<br></p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
From Cub Scouting they say you are going;<br>
We will miss your bright eyes and your smile,<br>
For they say you are taking the sunshine<br>
That has brightened our pathway awhile.<br></p>
<p>We have talked, we have sung, we have shouted;<br>
We have walked, we have swum, we have run,<br>
Done our best, with goodwill, done our duty, <br>
And we never missed the chance for some fun.<br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Now we’ve grown, over time, into Boy Scouts;<br>
Big adventures and excitement lie ahead.<br>
May we always remember the good times<br>
And the friends in this pack we have made.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
