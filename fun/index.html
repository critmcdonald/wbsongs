<h2 id="bear-in-tennis-shoes">Bear In Tennis Shoes</h2>
<p>The other day (echo), I met a bear, (echo)<br>
In tennis shoes (echo), a dandy pair. (echo)<br>
(All repeat with no echo.)</p>
<p>He said to me, why don’t you run<br>
Because you ain’t, got any gun.</p>
<p>And so I ran, away from there<br>
But right behind, me was that bear.</p>
<p>Ahead of me, there was a tree<br>
A great big tree, Oh glory be!</p>
<p>The nearest branch, was ten feet up.<br>
I’d have to jump, and trust to luck.</p>
<p>And so I jumped, into the air.<br>
But I missed that branch, a way up there.</p>
<p>Now don’t you fret, now don’t you frown.<br>
‘Cause I caught that branch, on the way back down.</p>
<p>The moral of, this story is:
Don’t talk to bears, in tennis shoes.</p>
<p>That’s all there is. There ain’t no more.
So tell me what, are you singing for?
(Don’t repeat the last verse.)</p>
<h2 id="bill-grogans-goat">Bill Grogan’s Goat</h2>
<p>This is a repeat song. The audience repeats every line after the song leader.</p>
<p>Bill Grogan's Goat, Was feelin' fine,<br>
Ate three red shirts, Right off the line.</p>
<p>Bill took a stick, Gave him a whack,<br>
And tied him to, The railroad track. </p>
<p>The whistle blew!, The train grew nigh,<br>
Bill Grogan's Goat, Was doomed to die. </p>
<p>He gave three groans, Of awful pain,<br>
Coughed up the shirts, And flagged the train!</p>
<h2 id="bingo">Bingo</h2>
<p>There was a farmer had a dog<br>
And Bing-o was his name-o. <br>
B – I – N – G – O, <br>
B – I – N – G – O,<br>
B – I – N – G – O,<br>
And Bing-o was his name-o.</p>
<p><strong>verse:</strong><br>

<h2 id="blowing-in-the-wind">Blowing In The Wind</h2>
<p>How many roads must a man walk down,<br>
Before you can call him a man?<br>
How many seas must the white dove sail,<br>
Before she sleeps in the sand?<br>
How many times must the cannonballs fly <br>
Before they’re forever banned?</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
The answer my friend, is blowin’ in the wind.<br>
The answer is blowin’ in the wind.</p>
<p>How many year must a mountain exist,<br>
Before it is washed by the sea?<br>
How may years must some people exist,<br>
Before they’re allowed to be free?<br>
How many times can a man turn his head<br>
Pretending he just doesn’t see? <br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>How many times must a man look up,<br>
Before he can see the sky?
How many years must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take ‘til he knows 
That too many people have died? </p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<h2 id="clementine">Clementine</h2>
<p>In a cavern, in a  canyon<br>
Excavating for a mine,<br>
Dwelt a miner,  'forty‑niner,<br>
And his daughter  Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
Oh my darling, oh my  darling,<br>
Oh my darling Clementine! <br>
You are lost and  gone  forever,<br>
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.</p>
<p>Light she was and like a fairy,<br>
And her shoes were number nine,<br>
Herring boxes without topses<br>
Sandals were for Clementine.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Drove she ducklings to the water,<br>
Ev'ry morning just at nine<br>
Hit her foot against a splinter,<br>
Fell into the foaming brine.<br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Ruby lips above the water,<br>
Blowing bubbles soft and fine<br>
But alas, I was no swimmer,<br>
So I lost my Clementine.<br>
(Chorus)</p>
<p>Then the miner, 'forty‑niner,<br>
Soon began to peak and pine<br>
Thought he oughter find his daughter,<br>
Now he's with his Clementine.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>In my dreams she still doth haunt me,<br>
Robed in garments soaked in brine.<br>
Though in life I used to hug her,<br>
Now she's dead I draw the line.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<h2 id="country-roads">Country Roads</h2>
<p>Almost heaven, West Virginia,<br>
Blue Ridge mountains, Shenandoah River,<br>
Life is old there, older than the trees,<br>
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
Country roads, take me home,<br>
To the place, I belong<br>
West Virginia, mountain Mama<br>
Take me home, country roads.</p>
<p>All my mem’ries gather round her,<br>
Miner’s lady, stranger to blue water.<br>
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky <br>
Misty taste of moonshine, tear drop in my eye. <br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>I hear her voice in the mornin’ hours she calls me<br>
Radio reminds me of my home far away.<br>
And driving down the road I get a feelin’<br>
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday. <br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<h2 id="deep-in-the-heart-of-texas">Deep In The Heart Of Texas</h2>
<p>The stars at night - are big and bright<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.<br>
The prairie sky - is wide and high<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.</p>
<p>The sage in bloom - is like perfume<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.<br>
Reminds me of - the one I love<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.</p>
<p>The cowboys cry - ki-yip-pie-yi<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.<br>
The rabbits rush - around the brush<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.</p>
<p>The coyotes wail - along the trail<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.<br>
The doggies bawl - and bawl and bawl<br>
Deep in the heart of Texas.</p>
<h2 id="do-your-ears-hang-low">Do Your Ears Hang Low</h2>
<p>Do your ears hang low?<br>
Do they wobble to and fro?<br>
Can you tie them in a knot?<br>
Can you tie them in a bow?<br>
Can you throw them over your shoulder like a continental soldier?<br>
Do your ears hang low?</p>
<p>Do your ears hang high?<br>
Do they reach up to the sky?<br>
Do the droop when they're wet?<br>
Do they stiffen when they're dry?<br>
Can you semaphore your neighbor  with a minimum of labor?<br>
Do your ears hang high?</p>
<p>Do your ears hang wide?<br>
Do they flap from side to side?<br>
Do they wave in the breeze?<br>
From the slightest little sneeze?<br>
Can you soar above the nation with a feeling of elation?<br>
Do your ears hang wide?</p>
<p>Do your ears fall off?<br>
When you give a great big cough?<br>
Do they lie there on the ground?<br>
Or bounce up at every sound?<br>
Can you stick them in your pocket just like little Davy Crockett?<br>
Do your ears fall off?</p>
<h2 id="down-in-the-valley">Down In The Valley</h2>
<p>Down in the valley, the valley so low,<br>
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow;<br>
Hear the wind blow, dear, hear the wind blow;<br>
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow.</p>
<p>Write me a letter containing three lines,<br>
Answer my question: Will you be mine?<br>
Will you be mine dear? Will you be mine?<br>
Answer my question: Will you be mine?</p>
<p>Build me a castle forty feet high,<br>
So I can see her, as she rides by;<br>
As she rides by, dear, as she rides by;<br>
So I can see her, as she rides by.</p>
<p>Roses love sunshine, violets love dew,<br>
Angels in heaven, know I love you;<br>
Know I love you, dear, know I love you;<br>
Angels in heaven, know I love you.</p>
<h2 id="follow-me-boys">Follow Me Boys</h2>
<p>Sergeant Reilley said, There’s a fight to win!<br>
Follow me boys, follow me!<br>
And it won’t be done ‘till we all pitch in.<br>
Lift your chin with a grin and follow me!</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
Follow me boys, Follow me!<br>
When you think you’re really beat,<br>
That’s the time to lift your feet,<br>
And follow me boys, follow me!<br>
Pick them up, put them down, and follow me.</p>
<p>It’s a long, long time, but we’ve got the will.<br>
Follow me boys, follow me!<br>
When we reach the top then it’s all down hill.<br>
Till you drop, don’t stop, and follow me!<br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Though the journey’s end is beyond our sight.<br>
Follow me boys, follow me!<br>
If we do our best then we’ve done all right.<br>
Pack your load, hit the road, and follow me!<br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>We were all packed in when the sergeant said,<br>
Follow me boys, follow me!<br>
We got off our backs and prepared our attack,<br>
When our sergeant hollered, Follow me!<br></p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>There’s a job to do, there’s a fight to win,<br>
Follow me boys, follow me!<br>
And it won’t be done till we all pitch in.<br>
Lift your chin with a grin, and follow me!</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<h2 id="ghost-riders-in-the-sky">Ghost Riders In The Sky</h2>
<p>An old cow poke went riding out one hot and windy day,<br>
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,<br>
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,<br>
A-plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
Yipi-ki-a, Yipi-ki-o, Ghost riders in the sky.</p>
<p>Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel.<br>
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel.<br>
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky.<br>
For as he saw the riders coming hard he could hear their mournful cry.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat.<br>
They’re ridin’ hard to catch that herd, but they ain’t caught them yet.<br>
They’ve got to ride for-evermore on that range up in the sky.<br>
On horses snortin’ fire, as they ride, I hear their mournful cry.<br>  </p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>As the riders loped on by, he heard them call his name,<br>
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on the range,<br>
Then cowboy better change your ways or with us you will ride,<br>
Trying to catch the devil’s herd across the endless sky.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<h2 id="ging-gang-goolee">Ging Gang Goolee</h2>
<p>Ging gang goolee, goolee, goolee watcha,<br>
Ging gang goo, ging gang goo.<br>
Ging gang goolee, goolee, goolee watcha,<br>
Ging gang goo, ging gang goo.<br>
Hayla, hayla shayla, hayla shayla hayla ho.<br>
Hayla, hayla shayla, hayla shayla hayla ho.<br>
Shally wally, shally wally, shally wally, shally wally.<br>
Oompah, oompah, oompah.</p>

<h2 id="im-an-old-cowhand">I’m An Old Cowhand</h2>
<p>I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande<br>
But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tanned<br>
I'm the cowboy who never saw a cow<br>
Never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how<br>
I sure ain't fixin' to start in now<br>
Yippee i oh ki-ay! Yippee i oh ki-ay! </p>
<p>I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande<br>
And I learned to ride before I learned to stand<br>
I'm a ridin' fool who is up to date<br>
I know every trail in the Lone Star State<br>
'Cause I ride the range in a Ford V-8<br>
Yippee i oh ki-ay! Yippee i oh ki-ay! </p>
<p>I’m an old cowhand from the Rio Grande<br>
And I come to town just to hear the band<br>
I know all the songs that the cowboys know<br>
'Bout the Big Corral where the dogies go<br>
Cause I learned them all on the radio<br>
Yipee i oh ki-ay! Yippee i oh ki-ay! </p>
<p>I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande<br>
Where the West is wild ‘round the borderland<br>
Where the buffalo roam all around the zoo<br>
And the Indians run up a rug or two<br>
And the old Bar X is just a barbeque<br>
Yippee i oh ki-ay! Yippee i oh ki-ay!</p>

<p>In a little cottage in the middle of the wood,<br>
A little old man by the window stood,<br>
Came a little rabbit hopping by,<br>
Knocking at his door.</p>

Before the hunter shoots me dead.<br>
Come little bunny, come with me.<br>
Happy we will be.</p>

<h2 id="johnnie-verbec">Johnnie Verbec</h2>
<p>There was a little Dutchman, His name was Johnnie Verbeck.<br>
He was a dealer in sausages, sauerkraut and spec.<br>
He made the finest sausages that ever you did see.<br>
But one day he invented a wonderful sausage machine.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:<br>
Oh, Mister Mister Johnnie Verbeck, How could you be so mean?<br>
I told you you'd be sorry for inventing that machine<br>
Now all the neighbors' cats &amp; dogs will never more be seen<br>
For they'll be ground to sausages in Johnnie Verbeck's machine</p>
<p>One day a little Dutch boy came walking in the store.<br>
He bought a pound of sausage and laid them on the floor.<br>
The boy began to whistle, he whistled a merry tune,<br>
And all the little sausages went dancin' round the room.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>One day the machine got busted the blamed thing wouldn't go.<br>
So Johnnie Verbeck he climbed inside to see what made it so.<br>
His wife was having a nightmare and walking in her sleep,<br>
She gave the crack an awful yank and Johnnie Verbeck was meat.</p>

<h2 id="oh-susanna">Oh, Susanna</h2>
<p>I’ve come from Alabama, with my banjo on my knee;<br>
I’m going to Louisiana, my true love for to see.
It rained all night the day I left,
The weather it was dry;
The sun so hot I froze to death;
Susanna, don’t you cry.</p>
<p>Chorus
Oh, Susanna, oh, don’t you cry for me;
I’ve come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee.</p>
<p>I had a dream the other night, when everything was still;
I thought I saw Susanna a-coming down the hill.
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth,
A tear was in her eye;
Says I, I’m coming from the South;
Susanna, don’t you cry.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<h2 id="red-river-valley">Red River Valley</h2>

For they say you are taking the sunshine,<br>
That brightened our pathway a while.</p>

Come and sit by my side if you love me.<br>
Do not hasten to bid me a-dieu,<br>
But remember the Red River Valley,<br>
And the cowboy that has loved you so true.</p>
<p>Do you think of the valley you’re leaving?<br>
Oh, how lonely, how sad it will be.<br>
Oh, think of the fond heart you’re breaking<br>
And the grief you are causing me to see.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>As you go to your home by the ocean,<br>
May you never forget those sweet hours<br>
That we spent in the Red River Valley,<br>
And the time that we shared ‘mid the flowers.</p>

<h2 id="redwing">Redwing</h2>
<p>There once was an Indian maid a shy little prairie maid<br>
who sang all day a love song gay as through the fields she'd while the hours away.<br>
She loved an Indian brave this shy little prairie maid<br>
And then one day he rode away to battle far away.</p>
<p>Oh the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing,<br>
The breeze is sighing, the night birds crying,<br>
For a far far away her brave is dying<br>
And Red Wing's crying her heart away.</p>
<p>She watched for him day and night,<br>
She kept all the campfires bright,<br>
And under the sky,<br>
Each night she would lie,<br>
And dream about his coming by and by<br>
But when all the braves returned the heart of Red Wing yearned<br>
For far far away her warrior brave fell bravely in the fray.</p>
<p>Now the Moon shines tonight on pretty Redwing,<br>
The breeze is sighing, the night birds crying,<br>
For a far beneath his star her brave is sleeping,<br>
While Redwing's weeping her heart away.</p>

<p>And we’ll all go out to meet her<br>
When she comes, “Hi, Babe!”<br>

These words came low and mournfully<br>
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay<br>
On his dying bed at the close of day</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
Oh bury me not on the lone prairie<br>
Where the coyote howls and the wind blows free<br>
In a narrow grave just six by three<br>
Bury me not on the lone prairie</p>
<p>It matters not I've oft been told<br>
Where the body lies when the heart grows cold<br>
Yet grant oh grant this wish to me<br>
Bury me not on the lone prairie</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Oh bury me not and his voice failed there<br>
But we took no heed of his dying prayer<br>
In a narrow grave just six by three<br>
We buried him there on the lone prairie</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
